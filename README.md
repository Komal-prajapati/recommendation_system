Recommendation System Project
Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a recommendation system using collaborative filtering with the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm. The system recommends movies to users based on their previous ratings from the MovieLens dataset.

Dataset
The project uses the MovieLens 100k dataset, which contains 100,000 ratings from 943 users on 1,682 movies. The dataset is widely used for benchmarking recommendation systems.

Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
surprise
matplotlib
You can install these libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn surprise matplotlib
Setup
Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/recommendation-system.git

cd recommendation-system
Download the Dataset

The dataset is included in the surprise library. You don't need to download it separately.

Run the Project

Execute the script to build and evaluate the recommendation system:

python recommendation_system.py
Project Structure
recommendation_system.py: Main script to build and evaluate the recommendation system.
README.md: This file.
Usage
Load the Dataset: The MovieLens dataset is loaded using the surprise library.
Build the Model: The SVD algorithm is used to build the recommendation model.
Evaluate the Model: The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is calculated to assess the model's performance.
Make Recommendations: The system generates top movie recommendations for users based on estimated ratings.
Visualize Results: Optionally, the distribution of estimated ratings is plotted.
